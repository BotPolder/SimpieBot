Letâ€™s get this project of the ground
Multiple definition written. Simple while loop that keeps the conversation going. 
Bot can now open google chrome and fire fox if installed in standard directory. 
Bot can also print a list of all .exe installed in C:\Program Files\\. 
Some simple if statements are used to give bot to possibility to respond to hi. 
An else statement will make clear that the question / command is not recognized by Simpie. 
Simpie is still in an early phase, and is not more intelligent than his friend SimpleBot. 
Simpie is written in Python instead of the Batch used to write Simplebot

Getting simpie crosplatform compiled
I had some issues with pyinstaller. 
Pyinstaller worked fine for my windows version of Simpie. 
But whilst trying to get it to work for Mac (get Simpie on the MacOS platform) 
I ran into some issues. At first terminal gave me a hard time with 
the pip installer. After finding a solution to that, pip installed 
my pyinstaller to python 2.7. This should not give any issues. 
Yet it did, the command pyinstaller was not recognised yet 
pyinstaller was defenetly installed in python 2.7. So after finding out about pip3. 
I simply installed pyinstaller with pip3. 
Now the pyinstaller works fine in terminal. 
Seems like python 2.7 does not have this function and python 3 does. 
No success in getting Simpie compiled outside of windows.

Getting simpie to start applications in the Operating System
    - Simpie can now open chrome if it is installd on both mac and windows.
    - Simpie can now also run almost all applications on mac and windows. This only if they are inside
        the applications folder for mac and the Program Files (x86) folder on windows. You are require
	to type the name of the application right because the searchfunction is casesensitive. For apple this 
	is easy because all .app files in /Applications are written with a upper case letter. In windows it is
	dependant on the application itself.
    - Simpie can now also check if an application is installed on mac and on windows.
    - The get user command will give the name of the user on both mac and windows
    - The help command will give a better view of what commands you can use.
    - You can now force simpie to print something in the terminal.
    - Simpie can give a list of all the applications installed on the device
        with 'both' simpie will print a dictionary with the folder of the 
        application and the name of the applicaiton.
        With 'names' simpie will just print the names of the installed applications.
    - The folder SimpieBot 0.1.1 Win was created with the standalone executable and a folder executable.

Very small patch. I fixed some minor crashes. New version of the application is ofcourse availeble. I dropped support
for the one file .exe becauses its performance is just not good enough. An installer has now been made for windows.
The program used for creating this installer is called advanced installer 17.1.1. It has a nice simple wizard design and
will enable end users to easily install simpie bot.

and than typing the command: update simpie.
Windows users will also not be forced to give up a name because simpie will gues it. Mac os still has the old name request. 
But darwin does not have an installer yet so that is not an issue / concern.
Update simpie will download the latest version of the bot to the download folder. (it does not matter if the client changed
the directory of the dowmload folder because simpie will find it anyway) After the latest update is downloaded simpie will 
start the .msi and close down.
Downgraded the installer to a simple .msi. This will stop windows from thinking that simpie is a virus. I did have to give
up the design for that. But this also got rid of the dumb pop up that it was a trial version. 
Boring look but more proffesional.
Also created a update simpie command and a version command that gives the current version. 
The lookup command will lookup anything you give to is. 
I now have a line of code for every day of the year in the SimpieSourceCode.py
