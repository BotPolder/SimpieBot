To get one single file:
Pyinstaller -n SimpieBot -i bot.ico SimpieSourceCode.py
To get admin permission: --uac- admin
Pyinstaller -n SimpieBot -i bot.ico SimpieSourceCode.py


Seems like the Pyinstaller for Mac is not working lets try py2app:

## create a virtual environment.
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv --system-site-packages
source venv/bin/activate
pip install py2app==0.13

## I used
Sudo pip3 install py2app==0.13

## Run into allias mode
python setup.py py2app -A
./dist/SimpieBot.app/Contents/MacOs/SimpieBot

## Delete the folders created by the allias moded
python setup.py py2app


## seems like the above did not work for me...
## how to fix...
1: uninstall pip2app:
sudo pip uninstall pip2app
2: reinstall but for python3
pip3 install pip2app
## my installed version was 0.21 (apparently ver 0.13 is more stable) but ver 0.21 worked for me.
3: I placed SimpieSourceCode.py and setup.py and bot.ico on my desktop in a folder called buildfile.
cd desktop
cd buildfile
python3 setup.py py2app

## my original setup.py
from setuptools import setup
setup(
    app=["SimpieSourceCode.py"],
setup_requires=['py2app'],
)

## my new setup.py
from setuptools import setup
APP = ['SimpieSourceCode.py']
DATA_FILES = []
OPTIONS = {
 'iconfile':'bot.ico',
 'argv_emulation': True,
 'packages': ['certifi'],
}
setup(
    app=APP,
    data_files=DATA_FILES,
    options={'py2app': OPTIONS},
    setup_requires=['py2app'],
)
