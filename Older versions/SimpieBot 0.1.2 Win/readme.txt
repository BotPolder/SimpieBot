I stopped support for the one file executable because its performance was simply to bad to run the bot. 
Now there is an installer available that will install the latest version of the bot.
The latest version can be directly downloaded here: https://github.com/BotPolder/SimpieBot/raw/master/Installer/Simpie%20Installer.msi
