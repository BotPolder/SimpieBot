# SimpieBot
SimpieBot shares a lot of similarity with SimpleBot, yet SimpieBot is written in Python and SimpleBot in Batch

SimpieBot is meant as an operating support bot. It can help the user do more complex things with the device without complicating
the user experience. Simpie is still in development. But you can use the software / program freely. Simpie works best on windows,
but it will also run fine on MacOS and Linux. Granted it is not yet tested on most all the linux distribution.
